# declaring vars

to declare a variable called "x" that contains the number 32, you type `int x = 32;`.
the "int" keyword means integer(signed)

if you want the variable to contain a signed number, type `int x = -32;`. By the way, "x" can be anything, if you've not caught on yet.

# data types

the "int" data type(nums -8388607 - 8388608) : `int foo = -10;`

the" uint" data type(nums 0 - 16777215): `uint foo = 10;`

the "string" data type: `string foo = "hello, world!";`

the "int8" data type(nums -127 - 128): `int8 foo = -125;`

the "uint8" data type(chars are numbers that cannot excede 255. IDK why i added this): `uint8 foo = 255`

the "bool" data type(true or false): `bool foo = true`
